If you use [`autotag`](/docs/run.md#autotag) as shown above, it'll ask to build the container for you if needed.  To manually build it, first do the [system setup](/docs/setup.md), then run:
```bash
jetson-containers build torchcodec
```
The dependencies from above will be built into the container, and it'll be tested during.  Run it with [`--help`](/jetson_containers/build.py) for build options.
